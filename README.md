# What is this?
A kubewatch alternative that supports CRDs. The plan is to add this functionality into kubewatch itself eventually.
It was created as a standalone tool just as a POC.

# Instructions
There are no prebuilt binaries yet, so you'll have to compile before running. Fortunately, that's simple.

1. Compile with `go build`
2. Run with `./robusta-kubewatch`
